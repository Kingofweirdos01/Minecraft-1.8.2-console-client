# Another minimal example: some properties may be omitted
# This is highly recommended for improving task readability

[Task]
triggerOnFirstLogin=false
script=startup.txt

# Of course, the tasks file can contain as much tasks as you want.
# Another example tiggered on logging in and every night at midnight:

[Task]
triggerOnLogin=false
triggerOnTime=false
timeValue=00:00
script=midnight.txt

# Example of task occuring every 30 seconds
# Could be used for making a custom antiAFK procedure

[Task]

timeInterval=30
script=Relogging.txt
